  - Prepare a document on what technology or approach would make sense for them going forward
    - Mobile app, would they benefit from one?
    - Which tech would be best?
    - Would a static website suffice?
    - Would a web app be better?
    - Hosting, database, backups...
- *Maybe:* Online advisory retainer
  - Following a roadmap or project
  - Designed for founders who are non-technical and have to steer through
  - (I'm probably not there yet this is in a few year's time.)

  - Problem: would be an entirely different audience
  - => Probably too much for now

with the customer. Following projects to start with
