{% capture bio %}
I'm a web and mobile engineer who helps entrepreneurs with building Minimum Viable Products. 
I follow lean startup and have founded businesses myself so I know what it takes.

I have thirteen years commercial experience in the IT services 
and software delivery industry. I've developed worked for big and small companies, I've spoken before audiences
and held trainings. Many years ago I gained a Master in Computer Science at the Technical University of Ilmenau, Germany. 

I make it my mission to be up to date with the latest tech, I tend to be pro-active and I communicate well.

The prospect of solving interesting technical challenges is what gets me out of bed in the morning. 
I'm an entrepreneur, I enjoy solving real life problems and working out how software can help the 
business move forward.
