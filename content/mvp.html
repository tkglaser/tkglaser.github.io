                    While I strive to write perfect code, the odd small bug is unavoidable
                    in complex systems like software. In this case I will fix it for 
                    free as long as the software is in use, guaranteed.

        Why take the uncertainty of an estimate when you can have a guaranteed fixed price upfront?

            I have written about this a few times and feel quite strongly about it.
            Every consultant should give a fixed price upfront for every project.
            No guesswork, no overruns, just reliability and no risk.
        </p>
        <p class="wow fadeInUp animation-delay-7">
            The way it works is that we sit down and define what your software is going to do
            and what it is not going to do. I will then give you a fixed price which is
            exactly what the project will cost you no more no less.

                I will involve you in the process as much or as little as you like.
                As soon as I have something to demo you I'll give you the opportunity
                to provide feedback. Once a final version has been agreed, I will hand everything
