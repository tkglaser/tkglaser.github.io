                    While I strive to write perfect code, the odd small bug is unavoidable
                    in complex systems like software. In this case I will fix it for 
                    free as long as the software is in use, guaranteed.

            I have written about this a few times and feel quite strongly about it.
            Every consultant should give a fixed price upfront for every project.
            No guesswork, no overruns, just reliability and no risk.
        </p>
        <p class="wow fadeInUp animation-delay-7">
            The way it works is that we sit down and define what your software is going to do
            and what it is not going to do. I will then give you a fixed price which is
            exactly what the project will cost you no more no less.

                <strong>So where's the catch?</strong> There really isn't one. The only thing I would say is that
                I offer this for my own code only. If someone else modifies the code, my warranty is void
                so to speak. Also a bug isn't the same as a new feature. If there is something you'd like the
                software to do, let me know and I'll offer you a price.
