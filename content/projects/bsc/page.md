## Bargain Sports Competitions

This web application was a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a startup.

### Functionality

On the web site the user is offered various competitions to take part in. Taking part means buying an amount of tickets. All tickets are numbered, a server side locking mechanism ensures that every ticket can only be sold once. To achieve this, once the user adds a ticket to the shopping cart, it is locked for fifteen minutes. If no payment is made within that time, the ticket is released and becomes available again.

The is an admin system that allows adding competitions and setting the winning ticket number. It also shows various financial stats.

### My contribution

I have written the entire application from database design all the way to the front end.

### Project duration

This project was completed within two weeks.
