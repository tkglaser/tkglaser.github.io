###  Knight Frank Property Search
This is the new Knight Frank property search application, code named **Search3**. 
I have redeveloped the entire stack of their application from the API to the frontend JavaScript.
The following technologies have been used:
- WebAPI
- ASP.NET Core
- Angular 1 (later converted to Angular 2 and 4)
- Webpack for frontend optimisation
