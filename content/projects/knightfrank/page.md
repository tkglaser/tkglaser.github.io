## Knight Frank Property Search

This is the new Knight Frank property search application, code named **Search3**.
This application replaces their previous property search and is a complete rewrite from scratch. This application is one of the key lead generators for the business and therefore of critical importance to Knight Frank.

### Functionality

The web application is designed to show residential and commercial properties for sale or to let. It allows to set search parameters like *location*, *maximum price*, etc. It then shows properties relevant to the search parameters specified.

### My contribution

I have written the entire back end using WebAPI based on a given existing database. I have then written the front end SPA, initially using AngularJS 1.4. In the mean time the app has been updated to Angular 4.1. The styling is based on bootstrap and written in SASS, which has been done by a UI engineer. I've also written all front end automation, initially using Gulp, now using Webpack.

### Project duration

The project was started in May 2016 and is still ongoing as the website is continually improving.
