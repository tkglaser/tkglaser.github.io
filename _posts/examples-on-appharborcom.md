Just a quick update. I'm currently working on getting some example applications up on [appharbor.com](http://appharbor.com/).

Here is the first one:

### [Phone number validation test app](http://playground.tkglaser.net/PhoneValidation/)

This is in reference to my last post, [Phone number validation in MVC 3](http://tkglaser.blogspot.com/2012/02/phone-number-validation-in-mvc-3.html).

Please let me know, what you think!
