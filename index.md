7 Reasons to hire me
Unlike my competitors:
- I give fixed project prices in advance
- I don't try to force petty change orders on you
- I never go over budget
- I offer a six month warranty in which I'll fix
all bugs for free
- I focus on startup companies.
- I can get your project done in weeks not months
- I am an entrepreneur myself, so I know what is important when turning an MVP into a validated learning exercise.
