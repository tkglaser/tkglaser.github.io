# Leadership

I have been a Technical Team Lead on and off throughout my career.
Whilst being at HM Informatik GmbH and Ingres Europe Ltd (2004-2010) I have led
various customer facing projects hands on and been a team member of
other projects. From 2014 to 2019 I was the Team Lead and Head Architect for
a web-based start-up. I was tasked with defining the overall architecture
and engineering best practices as well as building up the team of engineers.
I was doing all this while being a full stack consultant and doing things
like international trainings for Couchbase.

Overall I would say that I have **4 years** experience as a **Team Leader**.
I am now at a stage of my career where
I want to focus on hands-on leadership first and foremost.

# Experience

## McLaren Applied - Senior Software Engineer (contract)

*April 2019 - March 2020*

Co-architected and co-developed multiple Angular+NodeJS+.NET Core applications.

Frameworks/Languages: **Angular** (v9), **NodeJS**, **.NET Core**,
**SignalR**, **RxJS** (Reactive extensions for JS),
**NgRx** (State manager),
**NestJS** (API Framework for Node), **Angular Schematics**, **TypeScript**, **C#**

* I created a Template Web Application to Kick-Start customer projects. This
  consisted of a NodeJS backend handling security and administration and a
  frontend in Angular. This included CLI tooling to tailor the application to
  the project's needs. The CLI was written in NodeJS using Angular Schematics.
* Implemented 3D telemetry visualisation using ThreeJS and D3. The telemetry data
  was received from a .NET Core backend using SignalR. I've also worked on an
  Authentication layer in NodeJS against Auth0 using OpenID Connect.
* Co-architected a new authentication layer for the Telemetry Analytics
  Platform (.NET Core)
* Worked on the CICD build pipelines (Azure DevOps)

## Magnitude Internet GmbH – Team Lead & Head Architect, Co-Founder

*Oct 2014 – Jul 2019*

Designed and co-developed an E-Commerce Solution.

Frameworks/Languages: **Ms Azure Cloud**, **C#**, **ASP.NET MVC 5**,
**ASP Web API 2**, **AngularJS**

* I came in as the Chief Architect for this German Start-up company.
* Designed the cloud based architecture (MS Azure) for their
  multi-tiered product and mentored the team on the concepts used.
* Worked together with the CTO on implementing the CICD
  pipeline in Atlassian Bamboo. (It was a pain, I'd use Azure DevOps going forward)

## Invenias - Senior Software Engineer (contract)

*October 2018 – March 2019*

Re-implementation of Web-Based CMS in Angular 7.

Frameworks/Languages: **Angular** (v7), **RxJS** (Reactive extensions for JS),
**NgRx** (State manager), **C#**, **Visual Studio 2017**,
**Visual Studio Code**.

This client was struggling with performance issues, maintainability and
stability. I’ve taken the following steps to move them forward:

* Start to re-implement the application using several new concepts in
  a side-by-side way, so the improvements can be seen immediately.
  Many new features were implemented along the way.
* Introduce NgRx for client-side state management and caching.
* Migrate from Angular 4 to Angular 7 to take advantage of
  out-of-the-box performance improvements.
* Move them to the new Angular CLI build system. This took dev builds
  from 8 minutes down to 2.
* Set up code linting to highlight anti-patterns and use of deprecated features.
* Mentor the team on all the new concepts so that they can to move forward.

## Fiserv - Senior Software Engineer (contract)

*October 2017 – October 2018*

Re-implementation of Risk Assessment Software in Angular 5.

Frameworks/Languages: **C#**, **WebAPI**, **Angular** (v5),
**RxJS** (Reactive extensions for JS), **NgRx** (State manager),
**Visual Studio 2015**, **Visual Studio Code**, **MS SQL Server**.

The old version of the FCRM risk assessment software was implemented in
Silverlight and had to be re-implemented in Angular. This included writing a
REST API wrapper for the legacy server-side logic using WebAPI. The client-side
application was then created from scratch using Angular.

I did some work on the server-side back-end, but I mainly focused on the
client-side Angular application and ended up writing about 80% of the app on my
own. There was a heavy focus on observability (data changes in one part of the
UI affecting other parts), so we heavily used the NgRx, @ngrx/entities
and @ngrx/effects packages to manage and observe client-side state changes.

## Knight Frank - Senior Software Engineer

*July 2015 – September 2017*

Extending and updating Knight Frank's web presence.

**AngularJS** (1.x) **Angular** (2.x), **jQuery**, **ASP WebApi**,
**WebForms**, **Visual Studio 2015**, **MS SQL Server**

have also done multiple smaller projects for Knight Frank, including:
