## Profile

I have 14 years commercial experience in the IT services and software delivery industry. During this time I mainly fulfilled the roles of a Senior Software Engineer and Technical Team Lead. Prior to this I have successfully graduated as a Master of Computer Science at the Technical University of Ilmenau, Germany. 

I have an excellent track record from a technical point of view and received consistently positive feedback about my pro-active approach, outstanding communication skills and team work.

In addition to interesting technical tasks, a large part of my job satisfaction is coming from solving real-life customer needs and I enjoy ongoing interaction with stakeholders as only this ensures the best outcome possible.

## Experience

### Invenias - Senior Web Developer (contract)
*October 2018 – Current*

Re-implementation of Web-Based CMS in Angular 7.

Tools/Languages: **Angular** (v7), **RxJS** (Reactive extensions for JS), **@ngrx/store** (State manager), **C#**, **Visual Studio 2017**, **Visual Studio Code**.

This client was struggling with performance issues, maintainability and stability. I’ve taken the following steps to move them forward:

* Start to re-implement the application using several new concepts in
  a side-by-side way, so the improvements can be seen immediately. It is not just a like-for-like, many new features were implemented along the way.
* Introduce @ngrx/store for client-side state management and caching.
* Migrate from Angular 4 to Angular 7 to take advantage of
  out-of-the-box performance improvements.
* Move them to the new Angular CLI build system. This took dev builds
  from 8 minutes down to 2.
* Set up code linting to highlight anti-patterns and use of deprecated features.
* Educate the team on all the new concepts so that they can to move forward.

### Fiserv - Senior Web Developer (contract)
*October 2017 – October 2018*

Re-implementation of Risk Assessment Software in Angular 5.

Tools/Languages: **C#**, **WebAPI**, **Angular** (v5), **RxJS** (Reactive extensions for JS), **@ngrx/store** (State manager), **Visual Studio 2015**, **Visual Studio Code**, **MS SQL Server**.

The old version of the FCRM risk assessment software was implemented in Silverlight and had to be re-implemented in Angular. This included writing a REST API wrapper for the legacy server-side logic using WebAPI. The client-side application was then created from scratch using Angular.

I did some work on the server-side back-end, but I mainly focused on the client-side Angular application and ended up writing about 80% of the app on my own. There was a heavy focus on observability (data changes in one part of the UI affecting other parts), so we heavily used the @ngrx/store, @ngrx/entities and @ngrx/effects packages to manage and observe client-side state changes.
 
### Knight Frank - Senior Web Developer
