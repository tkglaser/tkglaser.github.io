Marketing strategy/braindump for tkglaser consulting.

## Positioning
### Consulting Services
- Fixed price custom projects
  - (Describe the process)
- Online Strategy Roadmap
  - One off fee (maybe post a fixed price on the website?)
  - One meeting with client (1-2h)
  - Prepare a document on what would make sense for them going forward
    - Mobile app, native, cross-platform or do they need one at all?
    - Static website?
    - Web app?
- *Maybe:* Online advisory retainer
  - Designed for Senior Executives who are facing a tech transition
  - (I'm probably not there yet this is in a few year's time.)
- *Maybe:* Tech training (for instance Angular)
  - Problem: would be an entirely different audience
  - => Probably too much for now
